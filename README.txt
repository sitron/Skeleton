This project is an attempt to build a basic skeleton for my RobotLegs based sites.

Features:
- xml sitemap (definition of site pages)
- site "flow" based on event mechanism
- basic menu auto build out of sitemap
- context menu

Todo:
- tree menu
- excluded page (to update url but don't show in menu)
- text and style utils (somaText for ex.)
- use RL loading utility rather than Bulkloader
- ...


Use it as you wish!
